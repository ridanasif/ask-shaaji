### Project Description
Shaaji ‚Äì The Ammavan Search Engine
Because Google doesn‚Äôt know how to think like your ammavan.

Tired of boring, factual search engines giving you accurate answers? Introducing Shaaji, Kerala‚Äôs first AI powered ammavan style search engine. Instead of precise results, Shaaji gives you overconfident, unsolicited advice sprinkled with gossips and life lessons you didn‚Äôt ask for with a lot of sass.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world faces a completely unnecessary crisis, no search engine talks or thinks like a true Malayali ammavan. Google may give accurate answers, but it lacks unsolicited advice, dramatic storytelling, and irrelevant childhood memories that make every reply special. Shaaji fixes this non problem by delivering overconfident, sarcastic, and gloriously off-topic answers, ensuring every search comes with a full dose of ammavan wisdom.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Shaaji solves this entirely madeup crisis by becoming the world‚Äôs first search engine that thinks and talks like a true Malayali ammavan. Instead of cold, accurate results, it delivers warm, overconfident answers filled with gossip, sarcasm, and life lessons you never asked for. Whether you search for ‚Äúrain holiday chance‚Äù or ‚Äúbest way to go Bangalore,‚Äù Shaaji responds with nostalgic stories, irrelevant side notes, and the unmistakable charm of an uncle who always knows better.
